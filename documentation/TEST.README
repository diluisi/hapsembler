----------------------------- TESTING SCARPA --------------------------

Last update: December 7, 2012

This directory should contain:

    sample.fq -> A fastq formatted file containing simulated paired-end
        Illumina reads of ~40x coverage. The mean insert size is 300bp.
		
	sample2.fq -> A fastq file representing another library with ~20x
		coverage. It contains simulated paired-end reads with an
		insert size of 800bp.

    TEST.README -> This file.

How to run the demo:

	** Note that you will need to have Bowtie (version 0.12.7 or later)
	installed in order to test Scarpa using this demo.

    1) Build Scarpa following the instructions given in 
	"scarpa-X.X/SCARPA.README".

    2) Add the full path of "scarpa-X.X/bin" to your system path.

    3) Change your directory to "scarpa-X.X/test". 
	
	4) Change the value of NTHREADS in ./scarpaDEMO to the number of CPUs
	available.
	
	5) Change the value of BOWTIEDIR in ./scarpaDEMO to the directory 
	containing Bowtie executables.
	
	6) Run ./scarpaDEMO
	
	If the demo is successful, you will find a file named "scaffolds.fa" 
    containing 1 scaffold of roughly 0.5 million base pairs.
