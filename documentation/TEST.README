----------------------------- TESTING SCARPA --------------------------

Last update: December 7, 2012

    This folder contains a toy dataset to test the executables and scripts
included in the Scarpa package. You should see the following files under
this directory:

TEST.README -> this file
contigs.fasta  ->  A fasta formatted file containing 93 contigs
reads.fastq  ->  A fastq formatted file containing 37500 read pairs with 300bp mean insert size
intermediate -> A directory containing 3 intermediate files

    The contigs were initially assembled using a different set of reads simulated
from a 250k region of human chromosome 22 (NCBI build 36). To run Scarpa on this
dataset, first execute the following command:

scarpa_process -c contigs.fasta -f reads.fastq -i 300

    This will create three files under the same folder:

contigs.fasta.scarpa.fa
contigs.fasta.scarpa.info
reads.fastq.scarpa.fq

    Map the file reads.fastq.scarpa.fq to contigs.fasta.scarpa.fa with your favourite
mapper in single-end mode. Make sure to tell the mapper to write the output in SAM
format and report only uniquely mapped reads since Scarpa can not utilize ambiguous
mappings. Assuming the output is named "reads.sam", run the following command:

cat reads.sam | scarpa_parser > reads.map

(ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN SKIP THESE PREPROCESSING AND MAPPING STEPS and use the files
located under ./intermediate for the command below.)

    Finally, execute Scarpa with the following options:

scarpa -c contigs.fasta.scarpa.fa -l contigs.fasta.scarpa.info -i reads.map -o scaffolds.fasta

    This should create a fasta file called "scaffolds.fasta" with 4 scaffolds
totalling around 249.5kbp (the results may vary slightly depending on the mapper).
